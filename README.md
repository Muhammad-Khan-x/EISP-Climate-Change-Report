# EISP-Climate-Change-Report
Tasked with producing a dashboard to examine European attitudes towards climate change during the 2016-17 period. 
This report aims to answer four main questions:
1. What was the general opinion of Europe on climate change?
2. How worried were Europeans about climate change?
3. What were European preferences towards different energy sources?
4. How did these opinions differ between European countries?
